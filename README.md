# Markov Model and Hodgkin-Huxley Formulations: Equivalence Testing Through Voltage Step Stimulation
## Computational Cardiology Project

This project was completed as part of the **Computational Cardiology** course at the **University of Bologna**, within the **Masters in Biomedical Engineering** program, during the **Academic Year 2023/2024**.

### Features:

- Implementation of Hodgkin-Huxley (H-H) formulations of the human ventricular myocyte Ito current, as described by Grandi, Pasqualini, & Bers (2010) ([*A novel computational model of the human ventricular action potential and Ca transient*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjmcc.2009.09.019)), in Simulink).

- Differential equations and transition rates for a 4-state Markov model of the Ito current.

- MATLAB and Simulink used to solve the Markov model and HH formulations of ITO.
